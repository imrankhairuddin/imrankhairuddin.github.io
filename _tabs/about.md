Hye, I'm Imran. Just ordinary Capture The Flag player. Passionate in `CTF and Digital Forensic and Incident Response`. I'm now working at a local information security company in Malaysia doing digital forensic, incident response and splunk. I have strong interest in digital forensic, incident response, some blue team stuff. Love offensive security as well as it improve my knowledge and the way I understand how attack works and ease me doing analysis on forensic. :octocat:

> **Alert**: Why my `octocat` tak jadi?
